# Insurance Industry and Insurance Cost Prediction Model

The insurance industry plays a crucial role in providing financial protection against unforeseen risks. However, insurance companies face many challenges in risk assessment and cost calculation, impacting customer protection and company finances. Risk can vary based on factors like age, occupation, and health status.

Calculating insurance costs is complex and requires considering various factors such as medical history and customer risk level. Inaccurate calculations can lead to inappropriate pricing, affecting customer satisfaction and company reputation.

To address these challenges, building a predictive model for insurance costs is essential. Using data analysis and machine learning algorithms, this model can predict insurance costs more accurately, helping companies assess risk and calculate costs precisely.

The team uses the US Health Insurance Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 1338 rows and 7 attributes.

## Table: Description of US Health Insurance Dataset Attributes

| Attribute | Description |

| children | Number of children |
| smoker | Smoking status |
| region | Residential region in the US (east, west, south, north) |
| charges | Medical costs covered by insurance |

The team chose the Linear Regression model to predict insurance costs. This simple yet effective approach helps analyze the factors influencing insurance costs and understand how independent variables impact the dependent variable.
